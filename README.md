Many who have recently joined may be asking: What is the purpose of this alliance? How is it different than others? What makes us unique? I intend through this posting to answer these questions, and to give you the foundation of our grand vision.

The Iskian Empire was founded by myself, Sabus Narian. I have played eve on and off for several years, always finding myself worn down the by relentless toil and fatigue that this game inflicts upon all of her players. EVE is unique in that the best aspects of many genres, Economy, Warfare, Guilds/Organizations, and the true strength of every game, the ability to give tremendous joy, as well as great sorrow, all of these characteristics are present in great quantity in EVE. And yet, it seemed for me that the perfect version of EVE, one in which one could play not just well, but on an incredibly skilled level, with an organization that truly exists not just to enrich the pocket of a single player, or a cabal of leaders, with the player as the mail focus of the goal, always seemed to never exist.

Whatever group that I found myself in always lacked that magic 'spark', that true sense of family that so many players hunger for in EVE. Some organizations were excellent at making money, others at making content, some were decent at both, and good in many other things, but many had terrible cultures, where you log in and are expected to player not for your enjoyment, but for the benefit of the leader, or the group of leaders. You had to participate in fleets to fight in wars that mainly occur because of the leader, not even wars of logical purpose, such as the accumulation of prime space for isk making or security, but just to increase the bragging right of the leaders, so that they can say that they have a massive empire of virtual star systems, made up entirely of pixels.

And so after so many disappointments, I was done with finding a new organization, I realized that I must build the exact and perfect community that I have searched for so long, but could never seem to find. 

And so The Iskian Empire, and Incompetent and Proud, were formed.

Now you will likely have on your mind: Sabus, I love the dream and the vision, but as you said, no alliance offers this, perhaps there is a reason? Sabus, how are we going to get to that level, where we can be the dominant force in EVE, in order to better the game as per your vision?

This is how. The most important part is you, the individual. All change begins with the small actions of single individuals, who begin to do small changes together with others, causing incredible events to unfold. This is why the three main goals of The Iskian Empire is the Accumulation Of Wealth, The Attainment Of Power, and The Betterment Of Gameplay. All three strengthen the individual capsuleer, you. Through this strength, you can buy Skill Injectors, play as Omega without paying real currency, and fly powerful and expensive ships that not only make you more money, make you more powerful, but also add to your gameplay. 

The second part is the collective. Like the old economic systems, we wish to improve all aspects of our organization together, so that we have a monopoly from start to finish. The ore will be Iskian ore, the minerals Iskian minerals, the ships and modules built will be built with Iskian blueprints, built in Iskian facilities, and sold in Iskian markets, to Iskians that will pay for them with Iskian isk. This way, all across the chain, profit will be had by Iskians, and our GDP as a group will grow. 

We will also have foundations that will take longer than most to build, but will be higher quality than anything else that can be found in other groups. We will have freedom of speech in our organization. In the beginning, this will lead to drama, arguments, and conflicts that escalate to their ultimate conclusion, but in the long term, we will have true freedom as we play, where we can criticize leadership and help them improve without risk of reprisal, and where we can have meaningful conversations that add true value to all who listen to them.

We will have as egalitarian and democratic of a government as we can. We will have leadership who will act as the benevolent kings of our organization, since the game mechanics are build for dictatorships, but we will strive to have a say in all things, improve whatever we may see, and work together with a level of trust that cannot be found in pure dictatorial systems. 

We will also learn from other groups. Each group has something that they do best of all, and we want to learn what it is, and do it ourselves. As we absorb refugees and new members, they will bring with them experience and knowledge that will allow us to do everything at the level of mastery than normal groups can only dream of.

And finally, we will dream. Because video games are meant to be improvements to stressful moments in our lives. After a long day at work, or a bad day, the best way to relax and remove stress is with an activity that you enjoy. Thus, we will always strive to better our group, even when it is perfect, we will strive to exceed perfection. That is our mission. That is what we do.

Sabus.
